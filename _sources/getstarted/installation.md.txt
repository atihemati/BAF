# Installation

[GAMS 47+](https://www.gams.com/download/), [Antares 8.7](https://github.com/AntaresSimulatorTeam/Antares_Simulator/releases/tag/v8.7.0) and the described [Python environment](#python-environment) are required to run the BAF. Running pre-processing (and some of the visualisations) also requires [R 4.2.3](https://cran.r-project.org/) and the setup described in [R setup](#r-setup). 

## Python Environment
Can be installed using [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) or [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/). A pixi installation will ensure that *all* packages are the same as in the time of developing BAF, while a conda installation through the `environment.yaml` could lead to different sub-packages being installed.

For pixi, simply [install pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation) and run `pixi install` in the top level of the folder. For conda, run `conda env create -f environment.yaml`.

## R Setup
The pre-processing scripts and some visualisations use [R packages for Antares](https://github.com/rte-antares-rpackage), developed by RTE. Open up R and install them with the commands:
```
install.packages("antaresViz")
```
