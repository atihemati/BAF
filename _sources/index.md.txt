# Balmorel-Antares Soft-Linking Framework 

The purpose of this document is to provide a practical guide on how to use the
Balmorel-Antares Soft-Linking Framework (BAF). For a scientific application,
see Rosendal et al[^1]. BAF is still at a very early stage of development,
meaning this relatively scarce documentation will be extended over time.
